## About Me
Hey there! 
I’m doing my bachelor in computer science in SRH Leipzig. I’m really to AI and AI ethics — fascinated by both what we can build and the responsibility that comes with it.
I also mess around with game and website development, as I love games myself, it is quite nice to try to build something I have always enjoyed doing in my free time.
What I´m up to: AI, AI Ethics, Game mechanics and probably learning 3 new things at once.

If you want to chat about projects or collaborate on something interesting, hit me up!
